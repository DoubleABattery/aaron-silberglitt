              <p>
                Violin and music in general is a great passion of mine. I’ve been playing violin since fourth grade and have been fond of it ever since. For the past couple years, I’ve been trying to practice at least an hour a day. I play in my school’s orchestra and have performed solos at school concerts. I also have played in youth orchestras outside of school, such as College Park Youth Orchestra (CPYO) and Senior All-County Orchestra for MCPS.

                Coding
              </h2>
              <p>
                I’ve always enjoyed coding and learning new things related to programming. I’ve learned Python, Java, JavaScript (through school) and HTML/CSS. A recurring project that I’ve made with multiple of these languages is the card game Blackjack. I’ve also made a Discord bot using Java Discord API (JDA). I have many plans for future projects.

              <p>
                I’ve been playing tennis on and off for four years and it is my favorite sport. It’s very challenging at times, but enjoyable nonetheless. My two brothers and parents also play tennis, and we play with each other every once in a while. I’m on my high school tennis team as well.
